# The general scope of cost to operate Japanese Bento Kitchens - A baseline open source analysis
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This analysis was completed as part of a personal project, but was not peer-reviewed or submitted for examination by experts in the field. Sources for the claims below are provided, and should be reviewed directly prior to any continuation of this research.
# Background

Japan's bento lunches are a style of small bunched lox famous throughout the world. Throughout the country not only are bento lunches brought to school or work but they are also sold throughout the country at train stations, convenience stores, and specialty shops. These are designed to be sold fresh, and companies producing bentos will produce thousands daily. 

This analysis looks at 3 kitchens that produce these lunches, and analyzes their food production practices in order to understand the feasibility of reproducing the same model in the United States.
# Methods and Scope

Four videos, covering 2 Japanese bento kitchens and 1 kitchen in Korea producing a similar product, were initially reviewed. Information from these videos was used to attempt to find equipment models, determine staffing count, identify other media related to the company, and measure their facility. This information, paired with open-source findings about ingredient price, equipment price, and staff wages, was used to understand the scope of the cost for different aspects of a bento kitchen.

A small set of considerations regarding utilizing a similar model for America can be found at the end of the analysis section.

## Limitations

Two major hurdles plague this analysis and prevent it from being more refined. These are the common limitations to open-source analysis (i.e. lack of publicly available information), and the language barrier when working with Japanese websites as a non-native Japanese speaker with low proficiency. Because of this, this analysis should be regarded as incomplete, with conclusions drawn only applicable in a general scope.

# Individual Company Profiles

## JR Plus's Shinkansen Bento Kitchen

JR-Plus (part of the JR collection of companies that operate a large portion of the train lines in Japan) produces bento meals daily for sale to passengers on the Japanese bullet train, the Shinkansen (JR Plus, 2025a; Paolo, 2021). The initial source of information on this company's kitchen practices comes from a video in the 'in Japan' series made by Paolo fromTOKYO on Youtube. 

JR Plus has multiple kitchens to service different bullet train stations, with our focus being on one located in Tokyo near Shiomi station (Baitoru). This building has 530 staff, presumably both kitchen and other staff, and produce between 8,000 and 10,000 bentos a day. In addition, they also produce approximately 2,000 rice balls for sale daily as well (Paolo, 2021).

Job advertisements posted for this company offer 1,300-1,750 yen ($9-$12 USD) per hour for production staff, 5.5 to 6.7 million yen ($38264.60 to $46613.24 USD)per year for quality control officers, and 187,000 to 224,000 ($1301 to $1558.41 USD) per month for manufacturing jobs aimed at new graduates (JR Plus 2025a; JR Plus 2025c; JR Plus, 2025d). 

The video does not give us an estimated amount of food imports, except specifying that approximately 260kg of rice is used daily (Paolo, 2021). The main information available from this piece is an understanding of the types of specialty equipment used in kitchens of their sizes, which can give us information on initial start-up costs.

There are three relevant machines that we can attempt to identify through visible logos or tags, included a vegetable washing machine, a spin dry machine, and a rice ball making machine. Attempts to find similar or identify the exact machines returned limited information about the prices of the machines, however from what little was able to be found these types of specialty machines will generally cost over 1 million yen, reaching past 2 and a half million yen often (YAMABIKO, 2025). 

Different portions of the video depict wide shots of the employees actively working product assembly, a couple notable shots indicate in the morning hours before delivery there are between ~18-30 employees broken up into different tasks. 

The building is broken up into two parts, with one portion measuring 35x53x25m and the second, smaller attachment measuring 17x10x25m. JR Plus seems to be vertically integrated in their delivery, with satellite imagery showing an attached garage with delivery trucks during the daytime. This would also account for a portion of the employees and space utilized (Google Earth, n.d. a). 
## Musashino Schools' Kitchen

Musashino, an area within Tokyo, has their schools serviced by a large bento kitchen nearby documented by two different videos. The first is in the 'Big Batches' series by the Youtube account Insider Food, and the second is another video by Paolo FROMTOKYO. 

Staff estimates range up to 70-181 staff, who service 3,000 school meals a day for up to 8 schools [^1] (Insider Food, 2023a; Paolo, 2022). Job advertisements posted in 2024 for cooking assistants and dishwashers advertised a 3.5-4 hour day for 7,100 yen ($49.39 USD) a month (Musashinoshi Kyusyoku, 2024). An unknown number of their staff are volunteers from families related to the school and community members (Paolo, 2022). 

Price estimates of 340 yen ($2.37 USD) per meal to 4,300 yen ($29.91 USD) per month per student is made possible by an unknown amount of government subsidies (Insider Food, 2023a).

The cooking process overall is described as taking four hours, with the food required for 3,000 meals is described as follows (Insider Food, 2023a):

| Item          | Amount |     Estimated Cost      |
| ------------- | :----: | :---------------------: |
| Daikon Radish | 120kg  | 27,000 yen [^3]<br><br> |
| Ground Pork   | 180kg  |    180,000 yen [^3]     |
| Shamai        |  40kg  |            -            |
| Rice          | 250kg  |    235,750 yen [^4]     |
[^3]: Data collected from M-Mart, see data sources addendum.
[^4]: Data collected from Komedonya, see data sources addendum.

One specialty piece of equipment could be identified from the Insider Food's video, appearing to be a steam convection oven from both a video and photographs provided by Musashino Kyusyoku on their website, which costs somewhere between 6.5-7.5 million yen (approximately $45,000 to $52,000 USD) for one unit (Nihon Kyushoku Setsubi, 2025). 

The building is described as being 3 floors and taking up 3/4 of the area of a football field[^2] (Insider Food, 2023a). Measurements of satellite imagery given us a main building and a side building, with the main measuring 3 stories of 43x39x30m, and the side building measuring one story at 35x11x13m (Google Earth, n.d. b). There is a visible line of trucks in an on-site garage, presumably used for delivery to the schools that are located close to the kitchen.

This kitchen shares photographs of its facility online through an official website, providing the minimum number of the following types of equipment (Musashinoshi Kyushiko, n.d.)
* 25-28 sinks
* 11 large steam rotary cookers
* 2-3 vegetable cutting machines
* 6 large deep frying pots
* 4 steam convection ovens
* 8 large specialty rice cookers

[^1]: Both videos give different estimates of staff. For the purposes of this analysis, the information from Insider Food will be primarily used.

[^2]: It is unclear if this is to mean one floor is the size of 3/4 an area of a football field, one room, or the entire building's footage. 
## Mugga Dosirak

Mugga Dosirak is a Korean company offering ready-to-eat meals, similar to bentos, delivered to workplaces through a subscription service. Though not a Japanese company, the workflow and food supplies are similar enough to give us some additional context for determining scope of operations in this type of business. The documentation comes from an additional video in the 'Big Batches' series by Insider Food.

The kitchen is described as having 18 staff members, including 3 'chefs', and serving 10,000 meals a week (Insider Food, 2023b). The video documents the process of one day's lunch production, resulting in 1,200 meals being delivered in the local area.

The food required for 1,200 orders is described as follows, with Japanese price estimations sourced for supplies measuring over one kilogram (Insider Food, 2023b):

| Item                           | Amount  | Estimated price from Japanese suppliers |
| ------------------------------ | :-----: | :-------------------------------------: |
| Green onion                    |  20 kg  |             13,000 yen [^3]             |
| White onion                    |  40 kg  |             12,080 yen [^3]             |
| Meat                           |  20 kg  |             20,000 yen [^3]             |
| Green Pepper                   |  10 kg  |             12,000 yen [^5]             |

| Black Pepper[^8]               |  500 g  |                    -                    |
| Cucumbers                      |  40 kg  |             22,000 yen [^3]             |
| Wild chive                     |  10 kg  |             29,000 yen [^6]             |

# Analysis

**Space:** Measurements were able to be taken for two of the companies profiled, each of them housed in a 3-story building with a main building and an attachment or additional building on the same ground. Both also house a garage for delivery trucks, and JR Plus Kitchen is confirmed to house non-kitchen staff in the same building.

Estimated maximum square footage of one floor for each company's main building:
- JR Plus Kitchen          - 1,855 sqft per floor
- Musashino School Kitchen - 1,677 sqft per floor

Assuming that the kitchens only require one full floor from these buildings, with another floor hosting a mix of other miscellaneous rooms, storage, and workspaces, and then a third for non-kitchen staff, the space needed for a kitchen this size can be estimated as a minimum of 1,500 square feet, with 1,750 likely being adequate for a small kitchen.

**Daily Ingredients:**
Two companies profiled revealed ingredient lists for a day of cooking. The estimated weights and prices in yen normalized to 1,000 bentos is as follows:
Musashino School Kitchen   -  196.6kg, 147,583.33 yen ($1,026.16 USD)
Mugga Dosirak              - 174.16kg, 380,502.5 yen ($2645.68 USD)

Giving us an expectation 180-190kg of food to produce 1,000 bentos on average.

**Equipment:** Information about specialty machines was more difficult to find, comparatively. One specialty machine was found to be in the price range of 1.5 to 2.5 million yen, and the other approximately 7 million. 

Musashino School Kitchen was shown to have a minimum of 32 specialty machines for their kitchen. Each kitchen profiled was also seen to have equipment and specialized room for sanitation purposes. Given the wide range these types of things may be found in, providing a scoping estimate is very difficult. It can be understood from this information that the start-up costs of a kitchen are likely magnitudes more expensive than the daily cost.

**Staff:** Two of the kitchens profiled used at least 18 staff for the actual production and preparation of the food. Musashino School Kitchen stood out as an outlier, with at least 70 staff, but there was no delineation made between how many staff were kitchen staff or staff that were volunteers from the community. 18 staff can be used as an approximation for minimum staff when planning a bento kitchen.

## Unknowns

The information listed above is currently the only information we have about the operations of these businesses, but there remains several aspects that could effect cost or feasibility when planning a mass-production kitchen.

* **Sanitation and cleanliness costs** - Both Japanese companies profiled employed very strict staff cleanliness requirements, including masks and gowns.

* **Facility cost** - Given the nature of the particular companies profiled, it's reasonable to assume they own the buildings housing their kitchens and do not have to pay rental costs to a landlord. This may not be feasible to reproduce on a wide scale in America, however.

* **Vertical integration benefit** - All companies profiled are vertically integrated at minimum with the food production and delivery, and Musashino School Kitchen additionally is tightly coupled with food suppliers in the immediate local area. It is hard to estimate how much this makes the business model more feasible and lowers overall costs.

* **Economy of scale** - Similarly, it's very difficult to estimate how much costs for ingredients or other necessities can be lowered by leveraging the scale and consistency of orders when making agreements with suppliers.

* **Packaging costs** - The packaging costs for each bento are not clear at this point.

* **Energy costs** - Similarly, the energy costs for running the kitchen for a work day are difficult to estimate.
## Considerations for model export

In addition to the facility cost mentioned in the previous section, to estimate feasibility for the American market there are some things to be considered that will not be convert from Japan in a 1:1 manner. Depending on the area an operation is established in there are multiple aspects of bento kitchens that can vary heavily.

Ingredient suppliers and transportation are difficult to find consistent price conversions for, especially if a kitchen is focused on using fresh ingredients. Depending on local farms, as well as access to ranches or fish markets, ingredient selection will be very inconsistent from area to area and therefore cost can also be inconsistent. This may also have an implication on cooking techniques that will be used in a particular kitchen, which would then have implications for the initial start-up equipment needed and associated cost.

Kitchens established in America likely cannot be vertically integrated to the same extent that Japanese kitchens can be, at least at scale. Any newly established kitchen would not have the scale necessary to justify such integration, especially if the goal is to reproduce the business model in different regions across America. The requirement to work with local delivery options should be factored in to any analysis of this possible business model. 

Labor costs are severely different between Japan and America, and options should be explored to minimize the possibility of a high labor cost, especially as the company scales. These options could include adopting different business practices on the administrative side, or attempting to introduce new technology for the kitchen staff to use allowing a lower number of staff to achieve a larger output.
# Further research

Further researched should include more hands-on methods, to include correspondence and interviews with industry veterans and information requests from ingredient and equipment suppliers. Additionally through these hands-on methods, an attempt should be made not only to continue research on the companies profiled here, but specifically begin research on the practices of the bento suppliers for the large convenience store chains throughout Japan such as 7/11 and Lawson, both of whom sell pre-made bentos at their many locations throughout the country.

These companies will have the most experience in scaling these operations and establishing them anew in different regions, which could address some of the concerns expressed in the previous section.
